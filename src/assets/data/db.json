      "description": "What is Python\nPython is a general purpose, dynamic, high-level, and interpreted programming language. It supports Object Oriented programming approach to develop applications. It is simple and easy to learn and provides lots of high-level data structures.\n\nPython is easy to learn yet powerful and versatile scripting language, which makes it attractive for Application Development.\n\nPython's syntax and dynamic typing with its interpreted nature make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development.\n\nPython supports multiple programming pattern, including object-oriented, imperative, and functional or procedural programming styles.\n\nPython is not intended to work in a particular area, such as web programming. That is why it is known as multipurpose programming language because it can be used with web, enterprise, 3D CAD, etc.\n\nWe don't need to use data types to declare variable because it is dynamically typed so we can write a=10 to assign an integer value in an integer variable.",
